## About Me
I am a passionate Data Scientist skilled in full-cycle data science projectâ€”from building models to delivering insights. With **over 6 years of experience**, I have consistently delivered impactful solutions that drive decision-making and improve operational efficiency. Based in Seoul, South Korea, I have been instrumental in handling large-scale data for platforms serving **over 20 million monthly active users** and processing **millions of daily transactions**.

I specialize in machine learning and deep learning, using tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn to develop **predictive models**. My expertise extends to **data visualization**, with proficiency in Tableau and Seaborn, helping to turn complex data into actionable insights. Additionally, I have experience in time series analysis and natural language processing using techniques such as LSTM and Transformers.

Recently, I completed a Proof of Concept (PoC) project with AWS, utilizing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to explore innovative AI applications in business scenarios. I am also deeply interested in **Explainable AI (XAI)** and **Multi-modal AI**, having applied various interpretability techniques while exploring innovative applications that combine different data modalities.
